### Added
- **MCP Trace Display**: Detailed MCP call status visualization in execution traces
  - Real-time tracking of MCP tool calls with success/failure status
  - Execution duration and parameter logging for MCP operations
  - Integrated trace viewer showing MCP metadata

- **Auto Error Recovery**: Intelligent S-expression syntax error recovery
  - Automatic detection of syntax errors (e.g., missing brackets)
  - LLM-based regeneration with full error context
  - Multi-attempt recovery with detailed logging
  - Seamless integration with both CLI and TUI modes

- **TUI Integration**: Rich text user interface with enhanced user experience
  - 4-tab layout: Dashboard, Workspace, History, Settings
  - Real-time execution tracing with visual feedback
  - Complete S-expression display (no truncation)
  - Keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation

- **Unified Architecture**: Shared processing foundation
  - Common AgentService for CLI and TUI consistency
  - Unified ToolExecutor for consistent tool execution
  - Shared trace logging across all interfaces
  - CLI as testing interface for TUI functionality

### Enhanced
- **Execution Tracing**: 
  - Complete S-expression display in trace viewer
